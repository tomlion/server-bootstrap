# Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Setup

This document covers all the steps I followed to set up a base image for my [vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) boxes. I'm going to assume that you've got yourself virtualbox, and a copy of the Ubuntu 12.04LTS 64-bit iso. If you don't go grab them. I'm also going to assume that you know how to set up a virtual machine with virtualbox... if you don't there's plenty of docs out there.

There's a lot of room in here for you to do your own thing, those places should be pretty obvious. The goal of this setup was to get a minimal Ubuntu install with the basics set up (ruby, build-essential, etc.)

## OS Install

Assuming you've set up your vm with the iso mounted, and have booted it for the first time, here are all my answers to the installer questions. Remember, I'm creating a base box for vagrant, so some of this stuff follows their conventions.  Here's what I set my VM up with (for reference):

* 512 mb RAM
* 8 gig, dynamically sized drive (vagrant suggests 40, but I don't ever end up close to that)
* 1 core
* NAT networking
* USB & Audio disabled
* Port 2222 forwarded to 22 on the guest (networking, advanced, port forwarding, just fill in the host and guest ports)

Right, on to the install… assuming you can answer basic questions about keyboards and stuff, here are all the answers once things get interesting(ish):

1. Hostname of "vagrant-ubuntu-precise-64"
2. Full name: vagrant
3. Username: vagrant
4. Password: vagrant
5. Use weak password (it's a vagrant box, it's supposed to be easy to get into)
6. No encyrption of home dir
7. Whatever timezone's cool, we'll change it later
8. Guided, use entire disk w/ LVM
9. Yes to all disk-related questions
10. No proxy info
11. No automatic updates
12. Only open-ssh
13. Install grub
14. Reboot!

That's it. If you've done everything correctly, you should be able to SSH into the machine once it reboots with (from your host machine):

    ssh vagrant@localhost -p 2222

If that doesn't work, your port-forwarding settings aren't correct. Either that or you didn't set the username to vagrant and you should pay better attention when you copy-paste ;)

## Post Installation

Here's all the other stuff I do after the OS is up and running.

### Users and Permissions

As this is a development box, password-less sudo is fantastically useful. You can set this on your production machines, but you'll probably want to harden your login settings in the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` (turn off root login, permit only specific users, key-based auth only, stuff like that… use the internet if this means nothing to you).

Before we get into setting up our sudo stuff, let's undo Ubuntu's stupid use of nano as the default editor. Assuming you've just logged in using the above SSH command appropriate to your system, run the following:

    sudo su -
    update-alternatives --config editor

Choose `vim-basic` and hit "enter". Cool, now let's set some permissions:

    visudo

and add the following to the bottom of the file:

    %wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

Once you're done with that, let's create the group and add our user to it:

    groupadd wheel
    usermod -a -G wheel vagrant

Cool. Now run `/etc/init.d/sudo restart`, and log off the machine and log back in again (as the vagrant user). If you run `sudo which sudo` and don't get hit for a password, you did everything correctly.

### IP Tables Setup

Let's take care of some basic firewall rules. This is all wrapped up nicely in a script for us, but what we essentially do is create a basic rules file in `/etc/iptables.up.rules`. You can check out the contents of this on your server after running the script, or in the repo. After this is installed, we add a little pre-up script to make sure these are loaded on server boot as well. Run this as root (not sudo, actually as root):

    curl -L https://raw.github.com/masterexploder/server-bootstrap/master/scripts/iptables-setup.sh | sh
    
Once that's completed, run `iptables -L` and you should see something to the nature of:

    Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
    target     prot opt source               destination         
    ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere            
    REJECT     all  --  anywhere             127.0.0.0/8          reject-with icmp-port-unreachable
    ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere             state RELATED,ESTABLISHED
    ACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp dpt:http
    ACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp dpt:https
    ACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             state NEW tcp dpt:ssh
    ACCEPT     icmp --  anywhere             anywhere             icmp echo-request
    LOG        all  --  anywhere             anywhere             limit: avg 5/min burst 5 LOG level debug prefix "iptables denied: "
    REJECT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere             reject-with icmp-port-unreachable
    
    Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
    target     prot opt source               destination         
    REJECT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere             reject-with icmp-port-unreachable
    
    Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
    target     prot opt source               destination         
    ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere

If you want to make changes to your IP Tables rules, simply edit `/etc/iptables.up.rules`, then run:

    iptables -F
    iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.up.rules
    
and confirm everything worked with a quick `iptables -L`

### Basic Packages and Stuff

First, let's set the timezone to UTC. Run, as root:

    dpkg-reconfigure tzdata 
    
and choose "etc", then "UTC". The rest of this is all pretty self-explanatory, so just read this, then run it all as root:

    /usr/sbin/locale-gen en_US.UTF-8
    /usr/sbin/update-locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8
    aptitude update
    aptitude safe-upgrade
    aptitude install build-essential git-core htop curl -y
    
At this point, you could call it quits, but I suggest that you continue and install ruby as well.

### Ruby

This was taken from the following gist: [https://gist.github.com/2845824](https://gist.github.com/2845824). I'm keeping it here in case it disappears. You can read the script, but it basically grabs the dependencies, then installs ruby from source. So, run this (as root):

    curl -L https://raw.github.com/masterexploder/server-bootstrap/master/scripts/install-ruby.sh | sh
    
If you can run `ruby -v` and you get something, you've got ruby!

Now, let's make sure we've got rubygems up-to-date and get some basic gems installed. More stuff to run as root:

    gem update --system
    gem install rake bundler chef --no-ri --no-rdoc
    
You could probably throw rails in there, but not every server will need that shiz. That's it, you're good to go!
