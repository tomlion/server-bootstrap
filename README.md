# Server Bootstrap

I've done a ton of work setting up various servers, but I've never really made it a point to document everything
that I do... I aim to fix that with this repo.

Basically, I have set up a bunch of ubuntu servers in the past, and am in the process of setting up some new 12.04 LTS
servers to run my rails apps. It seemed like it was time to document EVERYTHING that I do, partly to share my knowledge,
and partly to keep me from forgetting what the hell it is I do every time.

I'm also including various scripts that are useful for bootstrapping various setups and configurations.

Finally, there's also good stuff around various other things like chef, nginx configs, capistrano stuff, and more. I'll do
my best to note where I get everything from, but if you see something here that's yours and I haven't credited you, lemme know
and I'll make things right.

## IMPORTANT!

I will not support you, I provide no warranty, use this stuff at your own risk, etc. I'm happy to collaborate on this stuff, but
you're on your own with a lot of it.

## Contributing

Fork, pull request, done. If you've got something cool to add, I'll probably take it.
