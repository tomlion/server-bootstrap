# Custom Cookbooks

These are the cookbooks that I use in my infrastructure, and are in no way meant for general public consumption. However, I feel that there's
still stuff in here that might be useful to other people, so feel free to use them, but I would highly suggest you read through each cookbook before
you use it on your systems.

These are only meant to be used on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, and have only been tested to run on machines that follow my server setup docs.
